## Hello world!
Hi, my name is Ishant Tiwari and I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Physics, IIT-Bombay, Mumbai, India. I am doing my doctoral work with Professor P. Parmananda in the broad area of experimental nonlinear dynamics and more specifically, dynamics of an ensemble of self propelled particles. Since my masters in Physics I have worked on the following subjects:-

* Self Propelled motion of camphor infused paper (Present work)
* Stochastic Resonance
* Synchronization
* Amplitude Death
